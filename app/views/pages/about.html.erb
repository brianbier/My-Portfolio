                    <h2>Hello. My name is <span class="highlight">Brian Bier</span></h2>
                    <p>This is my web developer portfolio where I share all of my favorite work. I know it does not look so great but in a few weeks it will be filled with amazing content. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exercising, feeding my fish, drinking good coffee, and flying my drone.</p>
                    <p>I recently completed Codecademy classes which is a 12 week introduction to web development. At codecademy we start tackling problems that center around projects designed to mirror real web development work. I enjoy learning from mistakes and feedback is always welcome. I am currently seeking a back end web developer position where I can continue learning and improving my skills.</p>
